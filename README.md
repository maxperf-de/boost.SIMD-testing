# boost.SIMD-testing
Some boost.SIMD tests and benchmarks used for a presentation within the Hamburg C++ User Group.

I've chosen simple vector tests (reduction) that will be compiled with different options, and 
executed on different Intel x86 CPU generations.

Next to this, the presentation will use the SIMD-accelerated sorting algorithm "floki" (see https://github.com/khegeman/floki)
